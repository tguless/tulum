Aldea Zamá in Tulum is feeling unusually quiet right now—your observation of empty apartments is spot-on, and it's not just you noticing this. Here's what's going on:

---

### 🏘️ 1. Massive Post‑Pandemic Construction Boom

During COVID, demand for Tulum real estate surged. Developers rushed to capitalize, leading to a wave of construction—particularly in Aldea Zamá. But tourism growth after the pandemic failed to keep pace, resulting in *too many condos and not enough renters or buyers* ([thelatinvestor.com][1]).

---

### 📉 2. Oversupply Has Crushed the Market

* **Vacancy rates skyrocketing** for standard one- and two‑bedroom units, which often now only break even ([thelatinvestor.com][1]).
* Agents and developers are offering deep discounts, flexible payments, and incentives just to move inventory ([thelatinvestor.com][1]).

---

### 🚧 3. Infrastructure Lag, Dirt Roads & Unfinished Projects

Rapid development outpaced infrastructure improvements—roads remain unfinished, services (water, sewage, power) are inconsistent, and trash buildup is common ([reddit.com][2]). Some entire projects have stalled or been abandoned .

---

### 💵 4. Changing Tourist & Investor Dynamics

While luxury villas and eco-lodges continue finding high-end renters (8 %+ yields), the mass-market condos aren't attracting enough demand ([thelatinvestor.com][1]). Airbnb and vacation rentals show a glut of listings with low rental rates .

---

### 🧭 5. What This Means for You

* **Walking through a neighborhood full of empty units isn’t a fluke—it's a market signal.**
* This aligns with rising "For Rent" / "For Sale" signs and slower absorption times (months instead of weeks) ([thelatinvestor.com][1]).
* Aldea Zamá, once a darling of investors, is now seeing the ripple effects of overdevelopment.

---

### 🔮 The Outlook Ahead

* **Short‑term:** Expect more vacancy, slower sales, and downward price pressure in the condo segment.
* **Mid‑ to long‑term:** Infrastructure improvements—the new Tulum Airport and Maya Train—can revive appeal ([thewanderinginvestor.com][3], [thelatinvestor.com][1]). But absorption will likely take time.

---

### ✅ So, Why Is It Empty?

* **Too many apartments built too fast.**
* **Demand didn’t match expectations,** especially for standard units.
* **Infrastructure hasn’t caught up.**
* **Investors got cold feet on price wars and low yields.**

If you're exploring a move, investment, or just curious, it's wise to:

* Track infrastructure progress (airport, roads, utilities).
* Distinguish between luxury vs standard properties.
* Consider alternatives like condos in the Centro or beachfront villas, which show stronger demand and lower risk.
